-->Requirements to run the project:
1.) .net envirnoment installed in Visual Studio code .(You Can do it by running the command 'dotnet new console' in vs code)
2.) node.js version 16.17.0 or above will work.

--> Instruction:
1.) Clone the repo.
2.) First Initialize the node server by typing command 'node main.js' in cmd of VS Code.
3.) Then run the c# code by entering 'dotnet run' in cmd of Vs Code.
4.) The output will be visible and a json file is created after execution of c# code.

Note: It is best to create to cmd terminal to run the project so that node server will run seperately and c# code will be executed seperately.

If any help needed to  run the project . Please be free to contact me..  :)
